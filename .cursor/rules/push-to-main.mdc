# Push to main after changes

After making edits to the codebase in this project:

1. **Commit** all changed files with a clear, concise message describing what was done.
2. **Push** to `main` (e.g. `git push origin main`).

Run these from the project root. If working in a git worktree, push from the branch that tracks `main` or merge to main and push as appropriate for your workflow.

Do not skip the push unless the user explicitly asks not to push or there is no git remote / main branch.
