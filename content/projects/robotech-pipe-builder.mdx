## Snapshot

- **Focus:** Mechanical design, fabrication, and integration
- **Date:** January 2026
- **Duration:** 36 hours
- **Team:** Dennis Roman, Noah Veron, Krish Shajpaul, Nayan Ramam
- **Outcome:** 2nd place in teleoperated track

> This page reflects my primary contribution area: mechanical architecture, rapid part design, print-ready iteration, and physical integration.

## Mission and concept

- Hackathon challenge: robot concept for future off-planet settlement support.
- Proposed system: clamp to an existing pipe, grab new segments, place, then climb and repeat.
- Why this concept: modular utility networks + repeatable teleop sequence under tight time constraints.

## What I owned (mechanical)

- Structural concept for the climbing/placement mechanism.
- Fast CAD iteration to maintain manufacturable geometry under deadline pressure.
- Print-ready part updates and assembly-fit corrections during integration.
- Packaging decisions to keep manipulator travel, alignment, and serviceability practical.

## Build execution in 36 hours

- Full scratch build: no prior CAD, no reused mechanism baseline.
- Parallelized work: mechanism, electronics, and controls progressed at the same time.
- End-to-end teleop stacking flow demonstrated.
- Vertical climb was blocked in the final run by a failed voltage regulator.

## Results and engineering takeaways

- **Competition result:** 2nd place (teleoperated category).
- Reliable subsystems: alignment behavior, manipulator reachability, and operator flow.
- Main blocker in finals: power-stage reliability under full-load demo conditions.
- Key lesson: robust power hardware is a hard requirement for validating mechanical capability.

## Next mechanical iteration

- Replace regulator stage with protected power distribution and redundancy.
- Add curved-pipe traversal.
- Add a pipe-locking feature to secure assembled segments.
