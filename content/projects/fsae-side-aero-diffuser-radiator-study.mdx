## Snapshot

- **Team/Program:** HyTech Racing FSAE-EV
- **Focus:** Side-aero aerodynamic performance and component-level load shifts
- **Compared configurations:** Base vs HT106-N0172
- **Primary KPI set:** Total CL, total CD, CL/CD, aerobalance, component contributions

## Motivation and objective

- Compare two side-aero package directions under matched conditions.
- Use simulation to prioritize physical build/test effort.
- Keep online reporting high-level while preserving competitive context.

## Numerical data (from side-aero report)

| Metric | Base Case | HT106-N0172 |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Total CL | 4.1367 | 4.2383 |
| Total CD | 1.4749 | 1.4964 |
| CL/CD | 2.8046 | 2.8323 |
| Aerobalance | 50.73 | 50.41 |

## Results and engineering takeaways

- HT106-N0172 improves total CL and CL/CD relative to the base case.
- Drag increases slightly, but aero efficiency still trends positive.
- The outcome supports the side-aero direction and informs future iteration priorities.
- This page is a high-level summary. Detailed geometry rationale and trade-study logs are available on request.

## Validation and reproducibility notes

- Matched metric definitions were used across compared variants for a clean A/B read.
- Run quality gates were applied before extracting final comparison values.
- Full setup documents and internal decision logic are kept private to the team workflow.
