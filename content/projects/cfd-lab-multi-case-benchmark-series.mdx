## Why this is one project

- Scan speed: one card communicates breadth faster than seven separate cards.
- Technical signal stays strong: the page still proves range across major CFD regimes.
- Detail control: enough evidence to build trust, without publishing every setup decision online.

## What this consolidated track covers

- Internal flow: convergent-divergent nozzle.
- Bioflow-style canonical case: 2D artery stenosis.
- External aerodynamic regimes: sub/transonic wing and airfoil contexts.
- High-speed compressible regime: supersonic wedge.
- Rotating-flow context: VAWT MRF workflow.

## Case index (fast scan)

- **Convergent-divergent nozzle:** Compressible internal-flow trend behavior with regime transitions. Key output: shock-sensitive field interpretation across nozzle sections.
- **2D artery stenosis:** Flow acceleration and pressure-drop behavior in narrowed passage. Key output: velocity/pressure trend consistency under constrained geometry.
- **Transonic NACA0012:** Transonic airfoil flow with shock-related response. Key output: regime-aware interpretation of field transitions near the airfoil.
- **Forced convection flat plate:** Boundary-layer-focused setup and near-wall behavior trends. Key output: correlation-minded wall behavior checks and profile tracking.
- **Vertical-axis wind turbine (MRF):** Rotating-flow context and wake behavior under turbine operation. Key output: flow-field structure useful for load/performance interpretation.
- **ONERA M6 wing (transonic):** 3D external-aero transonic behavior. Key output: shock/flow-feature mapping across wing surfaces.
- **Supersonic wedge:** High-speed compressible structure capture. Key output: stable shock-pattern interpretation for benchmark comparison.

## Case notes (quick-read cards)

### Nozzle flow case
- Compact internal-flow benchmark to validate compressible setup discipline.
- Useful for comparing contour behavior and feature placement trends.

### Artery stenosis case
- Demonstrates how geometric constriction shifts local acceleration and pressure losses.
- Shows cross-domain CFD reasoning beyond only external aero.

### Transonic NACA0012 case
- Used for transonic regime interpretation near streamlined geometry.
- Helps communicate shock-related trend awareness.

### Forced-convection flat plate case
- Boundary-layer-oriented benchmark reinforcing near-wall setup habits.
- Supports correlation-minded reporting consistency.

### VAWT MRF case
- Rotating-flow context for wake and region-specific flow interpretation.
- Complements fixed-geometry benchmarks with turbine-style physics.

### ONERA M6 transonic wing case
- Extends airfoil-level interpretation into a 3D wing-level context.
- Emphasizes large-scale transonic flow-structure reading.

### Supersonic wedge case
- Compact high-speed benchmark focused on shock-pattern interpretation.
- Useful for confidence checks in compressible trend reporting.

## What this demonstrates quickly

- Ability to move between very different physics while keeping modeling discipline.
- Verification mindset: checks are treated as part of the workflow, not an afterthought.
- Reporting clarity: outputs are organized for decision-making, not just plot generation.

## Public detail boundary

- Concise summary for portfolio; details available on request.
