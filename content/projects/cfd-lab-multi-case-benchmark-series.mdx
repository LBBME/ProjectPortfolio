## Why this is one project

- Recruiter scan speed: one card communicates breadth faster than seven separate cards.
- Technical signal stays strong: the page still proves range across major CFD regimes.
- Detail control: enough evidence to build trust, without publishing every setup decision online.

## What this consolidated track covers

- Internal flow: convergent-divergent nozzle.
- Bioflow-style canonical case: 2D artery stenosis.
- External aerodynamic regimes: sub/transonic wing and airfoil contexts.
- High-speed compressible regime: supersonic wedge.
- Rotating-flow context: VAWT MRF workflow.

## Case index (fast recruiter scan)

| Case | What was tested | One key output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Convergent-divergent nozzle | Compressible internal-flow trend behavior with regime transitions. | Shock-sensitive field interpretation across nozzle sections. |
| 2D artery stenosis | Flow acceleration and pressure-drop behavior in narrowed passage. | Velocity/pressure trend consistency under constrained geometry. |
| Transonic NACA0012 | Transonic airfoil flow with shock-related response. | Regime-aware interpretation of field transitions near the airfoil. |
| Forced convection flat plate | Boundary-layer-focused setup and near-wall behavior trends. | Correlation-minded wall behavior checks and profile tracking. |
| Vertical-axis wind turbine (MRF) | Rotating-flow context and wake behavior under turbine operation. | Flow-field structure useful for load/performance interpretation. |
| ONERA M6 wing (transonic) | 3D external-aero transonic behavior. | Shock/flow-feature mapping across wing surfaces. |
| Supersonic wedge | High-speed compressible structure capture. | Stable shock-pattern interpretation for benchmark comparison. |

## What this demonstrates quickly

- Ability to move between very different physics while keeping modeling discipline.
- Verification mindset: checks are treated as part of the workflow, not an afterthought.
- Reporting clarity: outputs are organized for decision-making, not just plot generation.

## Public detail boundary

- This page intentionally keeps the discussion concise and recruiter-facing.
- Full per-case assumptions, mesh decisions, solver deltas, and alternative model tradeoffs are reserved for interview conversation.
