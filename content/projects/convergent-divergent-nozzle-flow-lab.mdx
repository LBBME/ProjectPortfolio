## Snapshot

- **Course/Lab:** AE 4699 CFD Lab
- **Case type:** Compressible internal flow (convergent-divergent nozzle)
- **Solver:** ANSYS Fluent
- **Primary focus:** Choking behavior, Mach trend, and pressure trend consistency

## Mission and setup

- Build a clean compressible-flow case with explicit pressure inlet/outlet conditions.
- Confirm expected nozzle physics:
  - Flow accelerates through the throat
  - Throat reaches choking condition
  - Diverging section trends to supersonic exit
- Use contour interpretation to verify physical consistency before reporting.

## What I executed

- Defined stagnation-pressure inlet and static-pressure outlet target case.
- Solved and post-processed Mach and static-pressure contours.
- Reviewed field behavior against isentropic nozzle expectations.
- Structured results in a lab-report format for fast review.

## Results and engineering takeaways

- Choked behavior observed at the throat with monotonic acceleration downstream.
- Mach contour indicates smooth supersonic development toward the exit.
- Static-pressure field drops from inlet to throat and continues downstream as expected.
- Case reinforces the value of trend-level verification before deeper design claims.

## Validation and verification notes

- Compared contour trends to expected 1D compressible-flow behavior.
- Checked for non-physical shocks/artifacts in the baseline outlet-pressure case.
- Confirmed pressure and Mach trends remain internally consistent across field views.

## Reproducibility notes

- Reusable slide/report structure keeps setup and interpretation standardized.
- Boundary-condition values documented with explicit units and reference conventions.
- Output visuals captured in a fixed sequence for side-by-side rerun comparison.
