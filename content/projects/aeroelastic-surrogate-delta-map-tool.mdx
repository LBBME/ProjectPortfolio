## Project format (data-first)

This project is intentionally organized as a **data package + pipeline view** rather than a slide/image narrative.
The focus is the surrogate workflow architecture and the reproducible artifacts coming from the `Tailoring` folder.

## Pipeline map (MATLAB)

- `fullpipelinev1.m` orchestrates load -> calibrate -> delta-map -> artifact export.
- `calibrate_surrogate.m` computes closed-form `EI`/`GJ` from influence integrals.
- `run_beam.m` evaluates tip deflection/twist for scaled stiffness values.
- `delta_map.m` builds comparison tables and plotting artifacts.
- Supporting loaders: `load_yqz.m`, `load_tip_targets.m`.

## Data inventory

| Artifact | Source | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `delta_map_table.csv` | `demoexport/` | Surrogate outputs at selected stiffness scales |
| `delta_map_deflection_truth_crm.csv` | `Truth/` | Truth deflection targets for comparison |
| `delta_map_twist_truth_crm.csv` | `Truth/` | Truth twist targets for comparison |
| `demo_tip_targets.csv` | `datademo/` | Tip targets used in calibration workflow |
| `demo_y_qz.csv` | `datademo/` | Spanwise load descriptors used by beam solve |

> All files above are mirrored into `public/project-media/aeroelastic-surrogate/` for project-page traceability.

## Why this sits in Other Projects

- This entry is primarily a **surrogate modeling and data-engineering workflow** project.
- While the context includes CFD/FSI truth data, the work showcased here emphasizes:
  - calibration logic
  - reduced-order modeling structure
  - reproducible data outputs
  - pipeline organization
