## Why this is one project

- Recruiter scan speed improves when related studies are grouped under one clear storyline.
- This preserves technical credibility while removing repetitive card-level browsing.
- Full per-case setup detail still exists for interview discussion.

## Context anchor

This work sits inside the broader multi-physics and HPC-focused research environment of the FPCS group at Georgia Tech: [Flow Physics and Computational Science (FPCS) Lab](https://flow.me.gatech.edu/).

## Case index (fast recruiter scan)

| Case | What was tested | One key output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| IPW pipeline verification | End-to-end staged workflow from mesh/flow through DROP3D/ICE3D and post wrapper. | Comparison-ready artifact package for IPW-style review workflows. |
| RG-15 IPW2 reproduction | Bin sensitivity and grid-family trend behavior under a 2D-intent study strategy. | Stable trend interpretation with explicit sensitivity tracking across metrics. |

## Case notes (quick-read cards)

### IPW pipeline verification case
- Focused on repeatability across stage handoffs and deterministic run structure.
- Built for auditability: artifacts and metrics are exported in consistent package layouts.

### RG-15 IPW2 reproduction case
- Focused on trend reproduction confidence, not just one final curve match.
- Used level-based and bin-based comparisons to expose sensitivity in key outputs.

## What this demonstrates quickly

- Ability to structure complex icing workflows into repeatable, reviewable execution systems.
- Verification mindset: convergence and comparison quality are treated as first-class outputs.
- Communication discipline: outputs are organized to support technical decisions, not only visual plots.

## Public detail boundary

- This page is intentionally concise and recruiter-facing.
- Full setup assumptions, model deltas, and tuning decisions are kept for interview-level discussion.
