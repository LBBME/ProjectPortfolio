## When

- **FPCS Lab involvement:** Jun 2025–Jan 2026 (icing verification and IPW-style pipeline work).
  - **Summer Research Intern:** June–July 2025
  - **Undergraduate Research Assistant:** August 2025–January 2026

## Why this is one project

- This project builds systems progressively: starting with simple 2D cases, advancing to more complex 3D cases, implementing automation on those 3D cases, and ensuring procedures remain consistent on increasingly complex 3D geometries.

## Context anchor

This work sits inside the broader multi-physics and HPC-focused research environment of the [Flow Physics and Computational Science Lab](https://flow.me.gatech.edu/) at Georgia Tech.

## Case index

- **IPW pipeline verification:** End-to-end staged workflow from mesh/flow through DROP3D/ICE3D and post wrapper. Key output: comparison-ready artifact package for IPW-style review workflows.
- **RG-15 IPW2 reproduction:** Bin sensitivity and grid-family trend behavior under a 2D-intent study strategy. Key output: stable trend interpretation with explicit sensitivity tracking across metrics.

## Case notes

### IPW pipeline verification case
- Focused on repeatability across stage handoffs and deterministic run structure.
- Built for auditability: artifacts and metrics are exported in consistent package layouts.

### RG-15 IPW2 reproduction case
- Focused on trend reproduction confidence, not just one final curve match.
- Used level-based and bin-based comparisons to expose sensitivity in key outputs.

## What this demonstrates quickly

- Ability to structure complex icing workflows into repeatable, reviewable execution systems.
- Verification mindset: convergence and comparison quality are treated as first-class outputs.
- Communication discipline: outputs are organized to support technical decisions, not only visual plots.
