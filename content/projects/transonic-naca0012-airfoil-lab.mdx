## Snapshot

- **Course/Lab:** AE 4699 CFD Lab
- **Case type:** Transonic external aerodynamics (NACA 0012)
- **Solver:** ANSYS Fluent (density-based setup)
- **Primary focus:** Mach/pressure field behavior and coefficient validation structure

## Mission and setup

- Build a transonic airfoil case with consistent numerical settings across alpha values.
- Capture core outputs for interpretation and comparison:
  - Mach-number contours
  - Static-pressure contours
  - CL and CD trends vs angle of attack
- Keep assignment reporting aligned to validation expectations.

## What I executed

- Configured density-based transonic setup with compressible gas modeling.
- Built and validated fine mesh baseline around NACA 0012 geometry.
- Ran angle-of-attack cases and extracted coefficient tables.
- Organized outputs into comparison plots for fast trend reading.

## Results and engineering takeaways

- Transonic field behavior is captured with clear regime-sensitive contour changes.
- Fine mesh setup provides a stable baseline for coefficient trend comparison.
- CL/CD reporting structure supports direct validation against reference data.
- Assignment reinforced coefficient-first communication for aerodynamic decisions.

## Validation and verification notes

- Used planned validation plots (CL-alpha and CL-CD) as acceptance criteria.
- Checked output consistency across all alpha cases in one standardized table.
- Maintained one numerical setup template to reduce case-to-case drift.

## Reproducibility notes

- Mesh parameters and solver model choices documented in report slides.
- Post-processing sequence repeated identically for each angle-of-attack run.
- Slide deck structure reused for setup, convergence, and final metric reporting.
