## Project framing

- Independent motorsports aero development project centered on a Mazda MX-5 (NC).
- Objective: compare realistic concept options under packaging and implementation constraints.
- Portfolio presentation is intentionally concise, with full setup internals reserved for discussion.

## Case index (fast scan)

| Case | What was tested | One key output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Multi-concept package comparison | Baseline vs ducktail, diffuser, undertray, wheel-deflector, and combined concept. | Relative drag/downforce behavior for concept selection. |
| Convergence quality check | Residual and force-history behavior across compared variants. | Clear reporting windows and trend stability confidence. |
| Ride-height sensitivity | Vertical setup shift impact on downforce magnitude. | Monotonic trend supporting setup tradeoff interpretation. |

## Assumption-based takeaways

- Force-trace separation between concepts is sufficient for early screening decisions.
- Combined concept direction shows potential for stronger package-level effect than isolated devices.
- Ride-height sensitivity confirms practical setup dependence, making mechanical constraints part of aero decision-making.

## Public detail boundary

- This project write-up uses assumption-based interpretation suited for portfolio context.
- Detailed mesh, BC, and solver-control configuration can be provided in interview if needed.
