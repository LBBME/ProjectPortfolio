## Snapshot

- **Course/Lab:** AE 4699 CFD Lab
- **Case type:** 2D internal flow with stenosis
- **Solver:** ANSYS Fluent
- **Primary focus:** Pressure/WSS behavior and model-comparison interpretation

## Mission and setup

- Evaluate how stenosis and fluid-model assumptions affect artery-flow predictions.
- Use controlled case comparisons to separate geometric effects from constitutive-model effects.
- Track physically meaningful outputs:
  - Dynamic pressure contours
  - Velocity vectors/pathlines
  - Wall shear stress along artery walls

## What I executed

- Built case setup with fixed inlet velocity and pressure outlet boundaries.
- Prepared comparison logic across multiple cases before result interpretation.
- Generated field plots and wall-based metrics for trend-level analysis.
- Summarized implications for low-WSS/high-gradient regions in stenosed flow.

## Results and engineering takeaways

- Stenosis region shows expected local acceleration and field redistribution.
- Pressure and WSS differences between cases provide clear model-sensitivity signals.
- Wall-gradient behavior helps identify regions tied to elevated hemodynamic risk.
- Structured comparison makes it easier to justify model choices in future studies.

## Validation and verification notes

- Used convergence and residual targets as a minimum quality gate.
- Evaluated trends by paired-case comparison rather than isolated snapshots.
- Checked whether wall-metric trends were consistent with expected stenosis physics.

## Reproducibility notes

- Boundary values and expected outcomes documented before execution.
- Post-processing outputs standardized across all compared cases.
- Slide sequence can be reused for future artery-flow assignments and reruns.
