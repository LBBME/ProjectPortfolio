## Snapshot

- **Source basis:** Cornell SimCafe VAWT Part 1 + AE 4801 lecture material
- **Modeling style:** Steady-state MRF approximation (rotor spun at fixed RPM)
- **Turbine type:** Lift-based Darrieus VAWT
- **Primary objective:** Build a stable rotating-frame setup and interpret wake behavior

## Problem specification

| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Inflow velocity | 10 m/s |
| Angular velocity | 40 RPM |
| Rotor diameter | 12 cm |
| Blade count | 3 equally spaced blades |
| Chord length | 2 cm |
| Blade center radius | 0.04 m from hub center |

## Modeling approach

- Used a **Moving Reference Frame (MRF)** formulation to simplify transient rotor motion into a steady approximation.
- Defined rotating inner zone and stationary far-field zone with explicit angular velocity assignment.
- Used **non-conformal mesh interfaces** across zone boundaries and set Fluent interfaces for information transfer.
- Kept blade positions and hub-centered geometry consistent with lecture setup definitions.

## Results and interpretation

- Velocity contours show clear rotor interaction and an organized downstream wake.
- Wake non-uniformity across azimuthal blade position appears in post-processed flow fields.
- Turbulent kinetic energy contours show increased eddy activity in wake-dominated regions.
- Outputs are consistent with expected behavior for a simplified steady MRF VAWT study.

## Validation and reproducibility notes

- Validation focus was trend-level consistency (wake shape, velocity deficit, TKE distribution) under fixed setup.
- Setup assumptions are explicit: fixed RPM and frozen-flowframe approximation.
- Mesh-interface naming and zone definitions are documented to support repeat runs and peer review.
