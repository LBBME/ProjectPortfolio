## Project center

- This project is centered on your current BTZCL reacting-flow development work.
- Core goal: keep JiCF canonical comparison behavior while using OpenFOAM's built-in reacting chemistry stack.
- Outcome target: quantify where OpenFOAM reacting CFD aligns/diverges from the Cantera 1D reference under matched BC intent.

## Context anchor

This project is part of a propulsion and energy research ecosystem centered on combustion science at Georgia Tech: [Ben T. Zinn Combustion Laboratory](https://www.comblab.gatech.edu/).

## Workflow map

- **Reference baseline (JiCF-BC-calc-main):**
  - Cantera 1D counterflow runs tune inlet conditions for target `S` and `J`.
  - Canonical JSON outputs store BCs and flame-level metrics.
- **OpenFOAM plumbing checks:**
  - Diffusion-only check against analytical `erfc` solution.
  - Passive counterflow case generation and mixing-field validation.
- **OpenFOAM reacting stage:**
  - 2D reacting counterflow setup with chemistry/thermo/reaction properties configured in OpenFOAM.
- **JiCF-style compare loop:**
  - Preset selection + JSON ingestion from canonical reference when available.
  - OpenFOAM output written back in a JiCF-like schema.
  - Automated side-by-side Cantera vs OpenFOAM comparison report.

## Why this matters

- Moves from single-tool dependence to cross-solver comparison without losing data consistency.
- Preserves canonical case structure so regression and validation remain trackable.
- Establishes a reusable path for future reacting JiCF studies under the same comparison grammar.

## Public detail boundary

- This page is intentionally concise and public-facing.
- Full reaction mechanism tuning, solver-control sweeps, and lab-internal test matrix details are reserved for interview/lab discussion.
