## Project center

- This project is centered on my current BTZCL reacting-flow development work.
- Core goal: preserve consistent JSON outputs so Cantera and OpenFOAM results can be compared directly, while using OpenFOAM's built-in reacting chemistry stack.
- Outcome target: quantify where OpenFOAM reacting CFD aligns/diverges from the Cantera 1D reference under matched boundary-condition intent.

## Context anchor

This project is part of a propulsion and energy research ecosystem centered on combustion science at Georgia Tech: [Ben T. Zinn Combustion Laboratory](https://www.comblab.gatech.edu/).

## Workflow map

- **Reference baseline:**
  - Cantera 1D counterflow runs tune inlet conditions for target strain/jet parameters (S/J).
  - JSON outputs store boundary conditions and flame-level metrics.
- **OpenFOAM plumbing checks:**
  - Diffusion-only check against analytical `erfc` solution.
  - Passive counterflow case generation and mixing-field validation.
- **OpenFOAM reacting stage:**
  - 2D reacting counterflow setup with chemistry/thermo/reaction properties configured in OpenFOAM.
- **Reference compare loop:**
  - Preset selection and JSON ingestion from the reference when available.
  - OpenFOAM output written in a comparable structure for direct Cantera vs OpenFOAM comparison.
  - Automated side-by-side result reporting.

## Why this matters

- Moves from single-tool dependence to cross-solver comparison without losing data consistency.
- Preserves consistent JSON outputs so regression and validation remain trackable.
- Establishes a reusable path for future reacting counterflow studies with the same comparison approach.

## Public detail boundary

- Concise summary for portfolio; details available on request.
