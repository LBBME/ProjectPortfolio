## Snapshot

- **Project type:** High school independent aerodynamics research
- **Institution context:** Colegio San Jose de Rio Piedras
- **Timeline:** October 2023 to May 2024
- **Important scope note:** I did **not** run the CFD simulations myself in this project; I analyzed published CFD outputs and related data.

## Objective

- Compare how different winglet families influence induced drag, vortex behavior, and practical aircraft performance.
- Distill a large set of references into engineering-useful guidance for design selection.
- Balance aerodynamic gains with real-world implementation constraints.

## Method used

- Performed historical analysis of major winglet evolution in commercial aviation.
- Reviewed CAD model descriptions and geometry conventions from published studies.
- Synthesized CFD-based findings from literature across:
  - Lift-to-drag trends
  - Vortex clustering/dispersion behavior
  - Angle-of-attack and Reynolds-number sensitivity
- Mapped findings to operational considerations (range, endurance, manufacturability, airport constraints).

## Key findings from the high school paper

- No single winglet is universally optimal across all mission profiles.
- Blended and split-tip concepts show strong vortex-management advantages in many use cases.
- Raked wingtips can improve endurance/range in long-haul oriented scenarios by aspect-ratio effects.
- Variable-cant/canted concepts appear promising for adaptable multi-condition performance.

## What this project demonstrates

- Early technical maturity in reviewing and synthesizing aerospace CFD literature.
- Ability to write decision-oriented engineering documentation with evidence traceability.
- Strong foundation that later transitioned into hands-on CFD-heavy projects at college level.
