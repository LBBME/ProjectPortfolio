## Snapshot

- **Case type:** Supersonic external compressible flow
- **Primary objective:** Resolve oblique-shock-driven changes behind a wedge
- **Lesson basis:** Ansys Innovation "Supersonic Flow Over a Wedge"
- **Secondary view:** Wedge vs cone contour comparison

## Problem specification

- Uniform supersonic stream impinges on a wedge with a **15 degree half-angle**.
- Targeted outputs from the lesson scope:
  - Mach number downstream of shock
  - Static and total pressure behind shock
  - Shock angle
  - Pressure coefficient along wedge
  - Drag coefficient

## Setup and method

- Followed the structured workflow from lesson sequence (problem setup through numerical results).
- Used compressible-flow post-processing to inspect shock signatures in:
  - Density field
  - Static pressure field
  - Mach contours
  - Pathline patterns
- Organized wedge and cone figures in paired sequence for direct visual comparison.

## Results and interpretation

- Wedge case shows clear post-shock field shifts consistent with oblique shock behavior.
- Mach and pressure plots show distinct compressed regions near wedge surfaces.
- Density pathlines capture compression-driven flow reorganization downstream.
- Cone comparison provides an additional geometric reference for interpreting shock/field distribution.

## Validation and reproducibility notes

- Validation is tied to the lesson objective: compare CFD outputs with analytical shock-based targets.
- Fixed export framing allows quick rerun comparisons without presentation drift.
- Image package is organized by variable and geometry for consistent review.
