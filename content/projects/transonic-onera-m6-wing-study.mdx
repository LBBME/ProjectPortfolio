## Snapshot

- **Case type:** 3D transonic external aerodynamics
- **Geometry:** ONERA M6 validation wing
- **Objective:** Reproduce expected transonic pressure behavior and compare contour trends to reference studies
- **Learning path basis:** Cornell-origin SimCafe tutorial pathway surfaced through Ansys Innovation content

## Problem specification

| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Mach number | 0.8395 |
| Inlet temperature | 460 degR |
| Wing rotation/incidence | 3.06 deg |
| Inlet Reynolds number | 11.72 million |

## Setup approach

- Followed transonic wing workflow structure: geometry/mesh -> physics setup -> solution -> results evaluation.
- Focused on pressure and velocity-field interpretation around ONERA M6 under transonic conditions.
- Used consistent extraction views to make contour comparisons repeatable.

## Results and interpretation

- Surface/near-field pressure distribution shows expected strong gradients in transonic regime.
- Velocity vectors and wake visuals highlight flow reorganization downstream of wing.
- Symmetry-plane style contour behavior follows known ONERA M6 trend patterns used in tutorial validation discussions.
- Output set is suitable for quick A/B comparison after mesh or model refinements.

## Validation and reproducibility notes

- Reference comparison is based on published ONERA M6 benchmark context in the tutorial resources.
- Any mismatch is interpreted with attention to mesh resolution and boundary-layer detail.
- Reporting package is organized so reruns can be compared without changing visualization framing.
