## Snapshot

- **Course/Lab:** AE 4699 CFD Lab
- **Case type:** External forced-convection over flat plate
- **Solver:** ANSYS Fluent
- **Primary focus:** Mesh/convergence discipline and laminar-vs-turbulent trend comparison

## Mission and setup

- Build baseline laminar and turbulent flat-plate CFD cases.
- Evaluate expected behavior in:
  - Skin-friction trend along the plate
  - Thermal boundary-layer development
  - Residual convergence quality
- Use trend-based interpretation to connect numerics to physics.

## What I executed

- Created case setup with matched geometry and comparable boundary conditions.
- Solved both laminar and turbulent configurations.
- Generated residual plots for convergence tracking.
- Interpreted Cf and thermal-profile behavior against expected flat-plate theory.

## Results and engineering takeaways

- Residual histories provide clear convergence evidence for compared cases.
- Turbulent case shows expected stronger wall-shear and thermal transport behavior.
- Laminar case captures lower-gradient behavior with thinner near-wall transport effects.
- Assignment strengthened case-quality checks before final aerodynamic/thermal claims.

## Validation and verification notes

- Compared simulation trends to expected analytical/correlation behavior.
- Used mesh and convergence interpretation as first-pass validation gates.
- Kept laminar/turbulent comparison structure consistent across outputs.

## Reproducibility notes

- Setup-to-results workflow documented in a fixed assignment template.
- Case naming and slide ordering support quick reruns and side-by-side checks.
- Convergence and physics outputs reported together for traceable review.
