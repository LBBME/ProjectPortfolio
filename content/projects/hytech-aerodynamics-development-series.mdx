## Why this is one project

- Recruiters can scan HyTech aerodynamic range quickly without opening multiple similar pages.
- The page keeps technical credibility while avoiding oversharing competition-specific details.
- Detailed setup logic and geometry reasoning stay available for interview conversation.

## Case index (fast recruiter scan)

| Case | What was tested | One key output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Side-aero package study | Baseline vs variant package performance under matched comparison framing. | Clear direction on downforce/efficiency trends for package iteration. |
| Third-element optimization | Third-element flow behavior and influence on local aerodynamic performance. | Comparative contour evidence supporting further optimization direction. |

## Case notes (quick-read cards)

### Side-aero package case
- Used to evaluate aerodynamic package direction with consistent A/B reporting.
- Built to support fast engineering decisions between closely related configurations.

### Third-element optimization case
- Focused on local flow behavior changes near the third element and adjacent features.
- Used contour-driven comparison to identify promising optimization direction for follow-on iterations.

## What this demonstrates quickly

- Ability to translate CFD outputs into practical design decisions under team constraints.
- Strong comparison discipline for motorsport aero iteration loops.
- Clear communication of engineering outcome without exposing full internal thought process.

## Public detail boundary

- This page is intentionally concise and recruiter-facing.
- Full setup assumptions, geometry iteration logic, and team-internal trade studies are reserved for interview discussion.
