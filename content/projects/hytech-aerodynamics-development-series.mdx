## Why this is one project

- HyTech aerodynamic range can be scanned quickly without opening multiple similar pages.
- The page keeps technical credibility while avoiding oversharing competition-specific details.
- Concise summary for portfolio; details available on request.

## Context anchor

The project context is Georgia Tech's student-run Formula SAE electric program: [HyTech Racing](https://hytechracing.gatech.edu/).

## Case index (fast scan)

| Case | What was tested | One key output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Third-element (rear aero) optimization (2024-2025) | Third-element flow behavior and influence on local aerodynamic performance. | Comparative contour evidence used to decide which geometry direction to pursue next. |
| Side-aero package study (2025-2026) | Baseline vs variant package performance under matched comparison framing. | Consistent trend direction across matched A/B comparisons for package iteration. |
| Composites manufacturing support (2025-2026) | Carbon-fiber aero part fabrication workflow and implementation readiness. | Aero hardware build context aligned with design/analysis intent. |

## Case notes (quick-read cards)

### Side-aero package case
- Used to evaluate aerodynamic package direction with consistent A/B reporting.
- Built to support fast engineering decisions between closely related configurations.

### Third-element optimization case
- Focused on local flow behavior changes near the third element and adjacent features.
- Used contour-driven comparison to decide which geometry direction to pursue next for follow-on iterations.

### Composites execution case
- Added manufacturing-side support for carbon-fiber aero hardware, including bagging/fabrication workflow participation.
- Helped connect analysis intent to physical part execution by supporting build-readiness context.

## Timeline context

- **2024-2025:** Third-element optimization work.
- **2025-2026:** Side-aero package comparison work and composites manufacturing support.

## What this demonstrates quickly

- Ability to translate CFD outputs into practical design decisions under team constraints.
- Strong comparison discipline for motorsport aero iteration loops plus manufacturing awareness.
- Clear communication of engineering outcome without exposing full internal thought process.

## Public detail boundary

- Concise summary for portfolio; details available on request.
