## Problem framing

- IPW icing workflows often lose repeatability between solver stages.
- Manual stage handoff increases turnaround time and hidden setup drift.
- This project enforces deterministic run structure and reviewable outputs across every stage.

## Pipeline architecture

- Fluent meshing and solve are launched from templated journals/sbatch scripts.
- Flow state is transferred into FENSAP-ICE stages:
  - Flow
  - DROP3D
  - ICE3D
- Post wrapper scripts process outputs into fixed artifact folders:
  - `cuts_clean/`, `cuts_ice/`
  - `thickness/`, `mccs/`
  - `convergence/`, `logs/`

### Grid-independence evidence (journal-defined sweep)

The chart below is built from `ComposerV2/Run_L1T1` through `Run_L5T1` journal defaults and shows the structured refinement schedule used in the study.

## Verification and reproducibility notes

- ICE3D convergence outputs are captured as structured CSV (`iceconv.dat.csv`) for auditability.
- Thickness and MCCS extraction are performed at fixed span stations for consistent A/B comparison.
- Wrapper README and scripts define a repeatable sequence from conversion -> cuts -> metrics -> plots.
- This project page now points directly to generated outputs, not just narrative claims.
