## Project scope

- This is a separate IPW2-related project focused on **RG-15**.
- Goal: reproduce IPW2-style comparison behavior with a workflow configured to be as close as possible to a 2D study.
- Constraint: student environment did not allow native 2D meshing, so the setup was designed as a 2D-intent approximation.

## Case and setup highlights

- Reference context: public IPW2 RG-15 glaze case (CSV-based curve comparison workflow).
- Runs included:
  - Provided baseline grid with 1/3/7-bin sweeps.
  - Custom grid family L1-L4 plus provided baseline level for trend checks.
- Example droplet-bin definitions used:
  - 7-bin: 81.3/5, 51.2/10, 36.8/20, 26.8/30, 18.7/20, 12.5/10, 7.3/5 (um / %)
  - 3-bin: 61.2/15, 27.3/70, 10.8/15
  - 1-bin: 26.7/100

## Key numerical snapshots

### Provided-grid bin study (same grid, 76,891 cells)

| Bin setup | Beta_max | Mass-caught peak [kg/m^2s] | Max ice thickness |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 1-bin | 0.825 | 0.01073 | 0.00254 m (2.54 mm) |
| 3-bin | 0.802 | 0.01043 | 0.00261 m (2.61 mm) |
| 7-bin | 0.796 | 0.01034 | 0.00561 m (5.61 mm) |

### Grid-family sweep (L1-L4)

| Grid level | Element count | Beta_max | Mass-caught peak [kg/m^2s] | Max ice thickness |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| L1 | 80,000 | 0.6400 | 0.00832 | 0.00397 m (3.97 mm) |
| L2 | 158,000 | 0.6932 | 0.009011 | 0.00412 m (4.12 mm) |
| L3 | 237,000 | 0.5636 | 0.007327 | 0.00323 m (3.23 mm) |
| L4 | 380,000 | 0.5790 | 0.007527 | 0.00372 m (3.72 mm) |

## Grid-independence evidence

The chart in the carousel summarizes the measured L1-L4 progression and delta behavior between levels.  
Interpretation used in this project:

- Beta and mass-caught are comparatively stable by finer levels.
- Thickness is the most sensitive output and should be tracked with tighter near-wall/time-step control.
- The harness is suitable for continued IPW-style studies because setup parity and trend-check infrastructure are in place.
